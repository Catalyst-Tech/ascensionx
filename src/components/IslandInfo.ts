With two different renewable resources on the island, players will always have a way of generating in-game profit. Plus, with an increased amount of grass on the island, players will have more opportunities to generate randomized seeds for their island farms!";

Not only does the island come with a gigantic cave for you to explore, but the cave is also home to coal, one of the rarest resources in the Ascension Ecoverse game. Although it doesn’t seem to be much help crafting items just yet, it might be worth a player’s while to save their coal for later…";

The Oil Fields island is the rarest island in the game, providing players with an abundance of oil right at the start of the game!
