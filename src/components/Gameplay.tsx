        <h1>About Polygon</h1>
        <p>
        The $ASCN token is hosted on the Polygon network, which provides several key benefits for the development of the Ascension Ecoverse project.
        With plasma chain capabilities for in-game transactions alongside speed, security, and low gas fees, 
        the Polygon network is the perfect home for the $ASCN token and Ascension Ecoverse game.

        <h2>Start On Your Island!</h2>
        <p>
          Your Ascension Ecoverse journey starts on the Ascension Island NFT that you will call home. 
          These islands contain all the resources and systems that you need to kickstart your journey, and if youâ€™re lucky, some might even come with special traits that give you an in-game boost! 
          Learn more about islands below.

        <h2>Harvest, Craft, and Sell Your Way to Success!</h2>
        <p>
          Every resource on your island can be harvested, and either crafted
          into items, or sold! Harvest your resources and craft them into items
          for faster production, then sell off your produce to the Vendor for
          profits! Each resource takes time to harvest, and every crafted item
          has an associated cost, so it's up to you to determine the strategy
          that makes you the most profit!{" "}

        <h2>Watch and Mitigate the World Pollution Bar!</h2>
        <p>
          Just like in real life, every action you take has repercussions, and
          these repercussions are reflected on the World Pollution Bar (WPB). Climate-friendly
          actions will lower the WPB, while unsustainable actions will raise the
          WPB, keeping environmentalism at the top of players' minds at all
          times. Just remember, as the WPB rises, the entire Ecoverse will be
          completely reshaped! Storms, rising water levels, temperature changes,
          and other environmental disasters will make it harder and harder to
          harvest the resources you need to survive.{" "}
