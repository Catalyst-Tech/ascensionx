      <h1>About Ascension</h1>
      <p>
        Ascension Ecoverse is a real-time strategy crypto game where players
        collect, craft, trade, and collaborate to further the evolution of the
        human race. Throughout the game, players will work to accumulate as many
        in-game resources as possible, which can be used to build the cities of
        the future via the game's utility token, $ASCN.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Ecoverse, each player has a chance to impact the world in their
        own unique way, be it through research, harvesting, or creating. Each
        player's actions has distinct and long-lasting aftereffects, forcing
        players to make the tough decision between quick profit and long-term
        sustainability. Plus, with a fully autonomous economy, the Ecoverse
        provides multiple different ways for players to profit, assuming they
        don't bring the world down in the processâ€¦
